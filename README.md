# Front of House Restaurant-Simulation

## Description

The program simulates a restaurant. The simulation serves as a platform for conducting experiments related to queueing theory with certain probabilistic components. For simplicity, the simulation abstracts several elements. Specifically, the kitchen has no issues cooking for any number of customers at any given point in time.<br>

The simulation is comprised of multiple servers that can each serve/process multiple tables/jobs. However, each server has a certain soft capacity such that if they will become overburdened if they are assigned a number of jobs passed said capacity.
